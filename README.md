# braindump

A site for writing.

## MVP

 * One box for writing text
 * Ability to export all data in a reasonable format
 * a Stream
 * revision history
 * Mobile apps

## Database Stuff

 * `rake ar:migrate:new`
 * edit file
 * `rake ar:migrate`

## Resources

To run your site locally, run `rake local`.

## Thoughts

 * Add tests to all helpers
 * connect up Travis-ci
 * write a router that automatically creates routes for all helpers using json.
